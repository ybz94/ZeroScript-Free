# ZeroScript Free - AI Agent for your Local MCP Servers (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena, Meta AI)

Control the MCP servers on your PC with AI, for free. ZeroScript turns a normal AI chat (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena, or Meta AI) into an agent that works on your machine: just describe what you want, and it runs the commands of any connected [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (filesystem, git, GitHub, Blender, ...) - the same servers you would configure in an MCP-capable editor. No API key, no terminal, no coding required.

It's a Chrome/Edge browser extension plus a small local bridge that connects the chat to your MCP servers over stdio. **DeepSeek is the recommended provider.** ChatGPT, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena and Meta AI also work. On ChatGPT, screenshots and image input are disabled on purpose (its free tier caps files/images on a separate quota from messages, so vision would only work part of the day); ChatGPT also summarises its own context in long sessions, so ZeroScript re-states its operating instructions periodically (shown as a "Reminder" chip) to stop it forgetting it can run commands. Gemini and Kimi can be less stable: Gemini tends to stop using the ZeroScript commands in long sessions, and Kimi sometimes reaches for its own native tools instead of the ZeroScript commands. On Arena, keep the mode dropdown on **Direct** (ZeroScript only supports Direct mode).

## Setup

**Load the extension manually (Edge or Chrome):**
1. Go to `edge://extensions` (Edge) or `chrome://extensions` (Chrome)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `zeroscript-extension` folder
5. The extension is now active

**Then set up the Bridge:**
1. **Download the Bridge** from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sebattfg/ZeroScript-Free)
2. **Add an MCP server** - in the extension's ⋯ menu → **MCP servers** (name + start command), or edit `config.json` next to `bridge.py`
3. **Run the Bridge** - double-click `start.bat` (Windows) or `MacOS_Start.command` (macOS); a small window opens, the Bridge is running. On macOS, the first launch shows a Gatekeeper warning (normal for any downloaded script): click **Done**, then **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**.
4. **Go to https://chat.deepseek.com** (recommended), https://chatgpt.com, https://gemini.google.com, https://www.kimi.com, https://chat.z.ai, https://chat.qwen.ai, https://arena.ai, or https://www.meta.ai, open a new chat (only works on these exact addresses; on Arena use Direct mode)
5. Click **Start session** in the ZeroScript panel
6. Type what you want to build

## Architecture (for contributors)

The extension is split between a provider-agnostic core and per-AI-site providers:

```
core/config.js        system prompt, feedback strings, tool categories (global ZS)
core/parser.js        ZeroScript command parsing - pure string logic   (global ZSParse)
core/main.js          agentic loop, UI, camouflage, session state      (uses ZSProvider)
providers/deepseek.js everything DeepSeek-specific: DOM selectors, generation
                      detection, send mechanics, composer modes…       (global ZSProvider)
providers/gemini.js   same interface for Google Gemini (Angular DOM, Quill
                      composer, code-block masking)                    (global ZSProvider)
providers/kimi.js     same interface for Kimi / Moonshot AI (Vue DOM, Lexical
                      composer, segment-code masking)                  (global ZSProvider)
providers/glm.js      same interface for GLM / Z.ai (Svelte DOM, code-block
                      wrapper masking)                                 (global ZSProvider)
providers/qwen.js     same interface for Qwen / chat.qwen.ai (Vue DOM, network-tap
                      SSE stream, Monaco disposal guard)               (global ZSProvider)
providers/qwen-net.js MAIN-world fetch tap for Qwen SSE stream        (injected by manifest)
providers/chatgpt.js  same interface for ChatGPT / chatgpt.com (React DOM,
                      ProseMirror composer, CodeMirror reply reading) (global ZSProvider)
providers/chatgpt-cm.js MAIN-world CodeMirror tap: republishes each code block's
                      TRUE document (the rendered DOM truncates long
                      lines)                                          (injected by manifest)
providers/arena.js    same interface for Arena / arena.ai (React DOM, multi-model
                      playground, A/B-comparison auto-commit, Direct-mode gate) (global ZSProvider)
providers/meta.js     same interface for Meta AI / meta.ai (React DOM, textarea
                      composer, JSON-viewer + code-collapse masking)   (global ZSProvider)
background.js         WebSocket to the local bridge (provider-agnostic)
```

`core/main.js` never touches the host site's DOM directly - it only calls the
`ZSProvider` interface. To integrate another AI site: write a new
`providers/<site>.js` exporting the same interface, then add its URL pattern to
`manifest.json` (`content_scripts` + `host_permissions`) and to
`PROVIDER_URLS` in `background.js`. No core change required.

Smoke tests (plain Node, no dependencies - run them from this directory):

- `node test-parser.js` - the command parser (`core/parser.js`).
- `node test-chatgpt.js` - ChatGPT reply reading (`providers/chatgpt.js`),
  driven against a stub DOM: CodeMirror line joining, the `data-zs-cm`
  MAIN-world tap that long code blocks depend on, and subtree exclusion.

Both print `PASS`/`FAIL` per case and exit non-zero on failure.
