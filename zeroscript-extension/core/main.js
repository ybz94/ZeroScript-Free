  // extension sits there ready and waiting. Observed repeatedly on ChatGPT.
  //
  // The periodic tools reminder does NOT fix this: it re-anchors command NAMES,
  // but it never restates that the commands actually run. So providers that need
  // it set `resendSystemEvery`, and the whole prompt goes back in.
  //
  // Delivery rides on the next injected tool result rather than costing its own
  // message - free and invisible. But that channel dries up in exactly the case
  // this exists for (a model that has forgotten it can call tools stops calling
  // them, so no results flow), so a fallback sends it as its own masked turn

  //    UNDER-counts badly: these sites virtualize. Measured on a real ChatGPT
  //    session that had long passed the threshold - only 12 turns were rendered,
  //    the marker was not among them (so the walk silently counted from the top
  //    of the window) and it saw 5 injected results instead of the true total.

  //   • A.userStopped - the user halted; never relaunch against their intent.
  //   • lastGenAt recency - only resume a turn from a generation in the last
  //     few seconds; a turn rendered by load/scroll has no recent generation.
  //   • turnHalted - the turn itself carries the site's "stopped" marker.
  // Each turn is still resumed at most once (zResume marker).
  // Freshness window for the resume watchdog. Widened from 8s to 3 minutes
  // (2026-08) because 8s was the ONLY thing standing between an orphaned command
  // and its execution, and it was firing on legitimate work: a long generation
  // (a Qwen reply seen live writing for 400s+) makes the loop finalize early, the
  // generation then genuinely ends, lastGenAt goes stale within 8s and the
  // completed command is stranded forever with a grey "not run" - the user's
  // whole point being that they wanted it to RUN. This is safe because every
  // guard below is independent of lastGenAt and covers the cases this window was
  // nominally protecting: bootBaselineId (a reload-restored generation),
  // maxTurnId (a scrolled-back old turn), the result-below settled-history test
  // (survives a reload, unlike the executed map), the `executed` map, the
  // zResume dedupe and A.userStopped. As the `executed` map's own comment puts
  // it, re-execution is idempotent regardless of any lastGenAt misfire - "the
  // hard part (is this a live turn?) can be wrong without harm". The window is
  // kept, rather than removed, so a tab left open for hours still never
  // spontaneously fires a command on some later unrelated DOM churn.
