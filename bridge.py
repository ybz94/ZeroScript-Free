#  ZeroScript Bridge
#  Local WebSocket <-> local MCP server(s). Roblox Studio is the DEFAULT
#  server, not a requirement: any stdio MCP server declared in config.json
#  (filesystem, git, Blender, ...) works the same way.
#  The browser extension talks to this over ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>.
#
#  What this bridge exposes (aggregated into one tools/list):
#    - Every MCP server declared in config.json (by default: roblox), each
#      spawned as a stdio child and routed by tool name.
#
#  Roblox-specific behaviour (the Studio connectivity probe, the studio_watch
#  recovery loop, StudioMCP port forensics) only runs when a server with id
#  "roblox" is configured; with any other server set the bridge is fully
#  generic.
#
#  Design goals (robustness first):
#   - Each MCP stdio process is read by ONE dedicated thread; responses are
#     matched by JSON-RPC id (no "read the next line and hope" races).
#   - stderr is drained so a child never blocks on a full pipe.
#   - A dead server is auto-restarted and the failing call retried once.
#   - Tool calls are locked PER SERVER, so a slow server never blocks another.
#   - Every call ALWAYS produces a reply: a result OR a structured error.
#     Nothing ever hangs the agentic loop silently.

#    even when no place is open - only its "name" goes null. So presence != usable.
#  - get_studio_state: tells whether a PLACE is actually loaded. With a place open
#    it returns "Available DataModels: ..."; with the Studio on the home screen (or
#    the active place closed) it returns "...doesn't have a place opened / previously
