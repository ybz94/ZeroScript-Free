**ZeroScript** is a free browser extension that turns ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena or Meta AI into a Roblox Studio AI agent.
Control Roblox Studio with AI directly from your browser - read/edit scripts, run Luau, generate assets, all from a normal AI chat. No API key, no terminal, no coding needed.

> 🌐 **Website: [zerodev.tools/zeroscript](https://zerodev.tools/zeroscript)** the free Lemonade.gg / Luamotion alternative for building Roblox games with AI.

Eight AI providers are supported: **DeepSeek** (chat.deepseek.com, recommended), **ChatGPT** (chatgpt.com), **Google Gemini** (gemini.google.com), **Kimi** (kimi.ai, Moonshot AI), **GLM** (chat.z.ai, Z.ai), **Qwen** (chat.qwen.ai), **Arena** (arena.ai, a multi-model playground) and **Meta AI** (meta.ai). On ChatGPT, screenshots and image input are turned off on purpose: the free tier limits files and images on a separate quota from messages, so vision would only work part of the day. Gemini and Kimi can be unstable: Gemini tends to stop using the Roblox tools in long sessions, and Kimi sometimes uses its own native tools instead of the Roblox commands. On Arena, use **Direct** mode (ZeroScript only supports Direct; it blocks Start in Battle / Side-by-Side / Agent modes). DeepSeek is the recommended provider.

## ⚠️ ZeroScript is Free Beware of Paid Copycats

ZeroScript is 100% free and open-source. It always has been, and it always will be. There is no official paid version, no subscription, and no sign-in required to use the extension.

If you come across a site or extension using the ZeroScript name that asks for payment or account creation, it is **not** this project. The only official links are the ones listed at the top of this README.

## How it works

```
AI chat (ChatGPT / DeepSeek / Gemini / Kimi / GLM / Qwen / Arena / Meta AI, in your browser) -> ZeroScript Extension -> Bridge (your PC) -> MCP server(s) (Roblox Studio by default)
```

The extension runs inside the chat page (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena or Meta AI). When you type a request, it sends commands to the Bridge running on your PC, which drives Roblox Studio through the built-in MCP server.

### Any MCP server works, not just Roblox

Roblox Studio is the **default** MCP server, not a requirement. The Bridge speaks the standard [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) over stdio, so any local MCP server can be added alongside or instead of Roblox - the same servers you would configure in an MCP-capable editor (filesystem, git, GitHub, Blender, ...).

- **Add one:** ⋯ menu in the ZeroScript bar (on any supported AI page) → **MCP servers** → type a name and a start command (e.g. `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/dir`) → **Add server**. The bridge restarts briefly to load it.
- **Remove one:** the ✕ on its row - including Roblox Studio, if you don't use it. The agent then runs on the remaining server(s) only.
- **Or edit `config.json`** next to `bridge.py` and restart the bridge:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "roblox":   { "command": "launch_studio_mcp.py", "args": [] },
      "files":    { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/me/projects"] }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Using it:** in the AI chat, the agent discovers servers with `list_mcp_servers` and lists a server's exact commands with `list_commands` (passing `"server": "<id>"`). Everything else - the command format, the chips, the stop button - is identical to the Roblox flow.

When no Roblox server is configured, the Roblox-only bits (the place-loaded status, project memory) are simply skipped, and the status dot goes green when any connected server has tools.

### Use your servers from an external MCP client (e.g. Arena Agent Mode)

The Bridge also exposes the exact same tools over **MCP over HTTP** (Streamable HTTP transport), so any external MCP client can drive the same local servers - Roblox Studio, your added servers, all of them - without the browser extension. This is how to connect **Arena.ai Agent Mode** (or Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any other HTTP MCP client) to Roblox Studio:

1. **Run the Bridge** (step 3 above). The console window prints a line like:
   ```
   HTTP MCP endpoint (external clients): http://127.0.0.1:17614/mcp/9f2ab3c1...
   ```
   The long tail is a random access token - **the URL itself is the credential**. Keep it secret, treat it like a password. (The port is fixed to `17614` by default and binds to `127.0.0.1` only; set `ZS_MCP_HTTP_PORT=0` to turn the endpoint off.)
2. **Open a public tunnel to it** (the client must be able to reach your PC). In a terminal:
   ```
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:17614
   ```
   Cloudflared prints a public `https://....trycloudflare.com` URL. (Any tunnel that forwards to that local port works.)
3. **Add the endpoint in your client.** For Arena Agent Mode: paste
   ```
   https://<your-tunnel-host>.trycloudflare.com/mcp/9f2ab3c1...
   ```
   (the tunnel host + the `/mcp/<token>` path printed in step 1) into the MCP server settings and connect.
4. The client now sees the same tool set the extension uses - `get_studio_place_details`, `execute_code`, `add_server`, ... - and can drive Studio directly.

Notes:

- The endpoint is **read/write**: an external client can execute Luau and edit scripts, exactly like the extension. Only connect clients you trust.
- The token changes every time the Bridge restarts, so a stale URL stops working (404) after a restart - that is intentional.
- Kill the tunnel when you are done; nobody else can reach your Studio while the tunnel is up.

## Setup

> 📺 **Lost? Watch the [setup tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/kPKiZLZ9_Ps) it covers every step below.**

### 1. Download the zip and install the extension

Download the latest zip from the **Releases** page and extract it. The zip contains both the **Bridge** and the **extension folder**.

To load the extension:

- Go to `edge://extensions` (Edge) or `chrome://extensions` (Chrome)
- Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
- Click **Load unpacked**
- Select the `zeroscript-extension` folder from the extracted zip

### 2. Start Roblox Studio and enable MCP

Open Studio and load a Place, then enable MCP (first time only):

- Click **Assistant AI** in the top bar
- Click **...** (top right of the Assistant panel)
- Click **Manage MCP Servers**
- Click **Enable Studio as MCP Server**

> Not sure where to find these options? The [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/kPKiZLZ9_Ps) shows exactly where to click.

### 3. Run the Bridge

- **Windows:** double-click `start.bat` inside the extracted folder.
- **macOS:** double-click `MacOS_Start.command` inside the extracted folder. The first time, macOS will show a security warning ("could not verify... free of malware") - this is normal for any script downloaded outside the App Store, click **Done**, then go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and click **Open Anyway**. You only need to do this once.

A small window opens, that means the Bridge is running.

### 4. Start a session

Go to https://chat.deepseek.com (recommended), https://chatgpt.com, https://gemini.google.com, https://www.kimi.ai, https://chat.z.ai, https://chat.qwen.ai, https://arena.ai or https://www.meta.ai and open a new chat. The ZeroScript bar appears above the input box. Click **Start session**. Type what you want to build.

> Only works on chat.deepseek.com, chatgpt.com, gemini.google.com, kimi.ai, chat.z.ai, chat.qwen.ai, arena.ai and meta.ai - it will not work on any other site.
> On Arena, keep the mode dropdown on **Direct** - ZeroScript blocks Start in Battle / Side-by-Side / Agent modes (it only drives a single Direct reply).
> Gemini and Kimi can be unstable (model behavior, not the extension): Gemini may stop using the Roblox tools after a while, and Kimi may use its own native tools instead. If the AI starts answering in plain text instead of acting, remind it to use the commands or start a new session.
### 5. Watch the setup tutorial

## What the AI can do

- Read and edit scripts
- Run Luau code directly in Studio
- Inspect the game tree and instances
- Generate meshes, materials, and models
- Browse and insert from the Creator Store
- Control play-testing
- **Remember your project across sessions** persistent project memory saved inside your place

## New in 1.5.5

- **DeepSeek: the agent starts again on the new unified model.** DeepSeek merged Instant, Expert and Vision into one model and removed the model picker, which left "Start Roblox agent" stuck on "DeepSeek mode not ready". ZeroScript now recognises the new chat box, switches Search off and starts, with DeepThink left on.
- **DeepSeek: screenshots work on every chat.** Images no longer need the Vision tab (it is gone) - the unified model sees your Studio captures, one at a time or several in a row.

## New in 1.5.4

- **ChatGPT: the ZeroScript bar is back above the composer.** ChatGPT redesigned its input box and renamed the layout slot the bar sits in. ZeroScript kept asking for the old name, so the browser dropped the bar into a stray strip at the bottom right of the composer and squeezed the text field to nothing. The bar now takes the right row again, and it reads the layout live instead of trusting a fixed name, so the next redesign should not knock it out.
- **ChatGPT: long commands read cleanly on the new interface.** The same redesign replaced the code-block editor that used to hide line breaks and cut long lines off - the cause of the truncated commands fixed in 1.5.1. A 400-line block now reads back whole. If you are still on the old interface, the previous workaround is untouched.

## New in 1.5.3

- **Kimi moved to kimi.ai.** The old address, kimi.com, now asks for a Chinese phone number to sign in, which locked most people out. Open https://www.kimi.ai instead - the page is unchanged, the bar appears above the input box exactly as before. Reopen any Kimi tab you had on the old address.
- **DeepSeek: the Instant model can now run the agent.** Picking Instant used to leave "Start Roblox agent" spinning forever with no explanation, because only Expert and Vision were accepted. Choose Instant before starting and the session runs on it - much faster than Expert, without the reasoning pass. Images stay off on Instant just like on Expert; the Vision tab remains the only one that can see screenshots.
- **DeepSeek: a reply written in DeepSeek's own tool-call format no longer kills the turn.** DeepSeek occasionally answers with its internal markup instead of a ZeroScript command. Nothing recognised it, so the tool never ran, the raw tags stayed on screen and the agent stopped dead with you waiting. It is now caught, hidden behind a tool chip like any other command, and DeepSeek is told to rewrite the call properly.
- **ChatGPT: the bar no longer clips into the composer's rounded corners.**

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for older releases.
